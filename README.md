## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started ensure you have the necessary tools installed -PNPM & Node
(v21+)-, and then clone this repository:

### Installation

```sh
# Clone repo locally
git clone https://github.com/JadRizk/miniature-launchpad.git
cd miniature-launchpad

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Environment Setup

Before you start the application, you must configure the environment variables
for Supabase authentication and Umami analytics. Create a .env.local file at the
root of your project and include the following:

```sh
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

UMAMI_SCRIPT_URL=your_umami_script_url
```

For more information on setting up Supabase, visit the
[Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.com/).

### Useful Commands

- `pnpm build` - Build all packages, including the Storybook site
- `pnpm dev` - Run all packages locally and preview with Storybook
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages
- `pnpm changeset` - Generate a changeset
- `pnpm clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each
  package's clean script)

## 📦 Apps & Packages

Launchpad's Turborepo structure is designed to maximize modularity and
efficiency across multiple projects. Each app and package is tailored to
specific aspects of development, ensuring a cohesive and scalable ecosystem:

- **`apps/app`**: Our main Next.js 14 application, serving as the face of your
  digital presence. It integrates Supabase for robust authentication and
  leverages our unified component library to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **`apps/docs`**: A dedicated Storybook-powered site for documenting and
  showcasing UI components. It offers an interactive platform for developers to
  view and test component designs in isolation.
- **`packages/ui`**: The core of our UI development, this package includes
  reusable React components that ensure consistency and quality across all
  applications and projects within the repository.
- **`packages/tailwind-config`**: Provides a centralized Tailwind CSS
  configuration to maintain a uniform styling framework throughout all our
  applications and components.
- **`packages/typescript-config`**: Manages shared TypeScript configurations,
  facilitating consistent coding practices and error-free compilation across the
  monorepo.
- **`packages/eslint-config`**: Delivers a pre-set ESLint configuration designed
  to enforce stringent code quality and style guidelines for all JavaScript and
  TypeScript codebases.

## 🛠 Tools Powering This Repository

Launchpad leverages a suite of top-tier development tools designed to enhance
productivity and maintain high standards across the development lifecycle:

  tailored for efficient management of monorepos.
- 🚀 [**Next.js 14**](https://nextjs.org/) — A React framework for building
  user-friendly and scalable web applications.

  developing and isolating UI components, powered by Vite for near-instant
  feedback.
- 🔠 [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) — Enhances JavaScript
  with static types to improve predictability and maintainability of code.
- 🌊 [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) — A utility-first CSS
  framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- 🌐 [**Shadcn**](https://github.com/shadcn) — A modern toolchain for front-end
  development, focusing on performance and developer experience.
- 🔍 [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/) — A linter tool to identify and fix
  problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code, enforcing code quality standards.
- ✨ [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io) — An opinionated code formatter that
  ensures consistency in code style.

**Note**: Each package and app is 100%
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Workspaces enables us to "hoist"
dependencies that are shared between packages to the root `package.json`. This
means smaller `node_modules` folders and a better local dev experience. To
install a dependency for the entire monorepo, use the `-w` workspaces flag with
`pnpm add`.

## 🧑‍💻 Setting Up Supabase Locally

Setting up Supabase locally can significantly streamline your development
workflow. Follow these steps to get started with Supabase CLI for local
development:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine, as Supabase relies on Docker
containers to run the local development environment.

### Installation

1. **Install Supabase CLI**: First, install the Supabase CLI by running the
   following command:

```sh
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase
```

2. **Start Supabase**: Navigate to your project's root directory and initialize
   Supabase:

```sh
# Initialize Supabase in your project
supabase init
```

3. **Start the Supabase local development environment**: Run the following
   command to start the local Supabase environment:

```sh
# Start Supabase local environment
supabase start
```

This command will spin up the necessary Docker containers for Supabase,
including the database, authentication, and storage services.

### Configuration

1. **Configure Environment Variables**: Update your `.env.local` file to use the
   local Supabase instance. Replace `your_supabase_url` and
   `your_supabase_anon_key` with the values provided by the local Supabase
   environment:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_local_anon_key
```

2. **Migrate Database**: To apply database migrations, use the following
   command:

```sh
# Apply database migrations
supabase db push
```

This command ensures your local database schema matches your project
requirements.

### Useful Commands

- `supabase start` - Start the local Supabase development environment.
- `supabase stop` - Stop the local Supabase environment.
- `supabase db push` - Apply database migrations.
- `supabase db reset` - Reset the local database to its initial state.

For more detailed information on setting up and using Supabase locally, visit
the
[Supabase CLI Local Development Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development).

## 🧱 Components

Each file inside of `packages/src/components` is a component inside our design
system. For example:

```tsx:acme-core/src/Button.tsx
import * as React from 'react';

export interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function Button(props: ButtonProps) {
  return <button>{props.children}</button>;
}

Button.displayName = 'Button';
```

When adding a new file, ensure the component is also exported from the entry
`index.tsx` file:

```tsx:packages/src/components/index.tsx
export * from './Button';
```

## 🔄 Versioning & Publishing Packages

The project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for
version management, changelog generation, and npm publishing. The workflow is
designed to automate and streamline the release process, ensuring reliable and
consistent package updates.

### 🔧 Generating Changesets

When you make changes that should be tracked in the changelog, follow these
steps:

1. **Start the Changeset**: Run the following command in your terminal:
   `pnpm changeset`
2. **Select Packages**: The CLI will prompt you to select the packages affected
   by your changes. Ensure you create one changeset per repository to keep the
   changelogs separate.
3. **Version Bumps**: Decide on the version bump for the selected packages. It's
   crucial to follow semantic versioning best practices.
4. **Summarize Changes**: Write a clear summary of what changes have been made;
   this summary will be included in the changelog.
5. **Review and Confirm**: Confirm the details of your changeset. A Markdown
   file will then be created in the changeset folder, listing the packages and
   summarizing the changes.
